      occur to a level that you deem unacceptable, please contact our customer care at info@cakehub.ph to inform us 
      immediately with images to support your claim so that we can arrange a replacement at our next available

      hours of receipt in order to be eligible for a refund. If we offer you a refund, please note that banks generally

      offer introduction date or after the offer end date.<br>&nbsp;2. In the event that a customer has made a purchase 
      and the price of the purchased product subsequently falls or is discounted owing to a special offer, the price of 
      the product at the time of purchase shall prevail. We are unable to offer special offer discounts for purchases that 
      have already been made.<br>&nbsp;3. As our special offers are contingent on availability, we may change the terms of 
      special offers, or withdraw them altogether, at any time, and without prior notice.<br>&nbsp;4. We also reserve the 
      right, at our absolute discretion, to offer different personalised special offers and promotions and it will therefore

      otherwise stated, free or discounted introductory offers are only available to new users of the CakeHub, and are only 
      available once to any one person.<br>&nbsp;6. Discounts and credits cannot be used in conjunction with any other offers.

      able to deliver orders on time. This is outside of our control and we cannot accept responsibility for the late delivery 
      of the order. Therefore, in the event of adverse weather conditions, we aren't able to refund or offer re-delivery of 
      affected orders.</p>
